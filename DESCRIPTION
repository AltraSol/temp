Title: Manage Unstructured Data
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Chris",
             family = "Ulch",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "culch@ualberta.ca"))
Description: Methods to reliably structure data when the source format or 
  load point is expected to vary over time; or when inputs lack structure 
  completely and are not immediately compatible with typical data manipulation packages.
  For situations where connection points are pdfs or user-edited Excel sheets, 
  and table dimensions and naming conventions need to be dynamically set using pattern recognition.
