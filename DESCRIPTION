Title: Manage Unstructured Data
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Chris",
             family = "Ulch",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "culch@ualberta.ca"))
Description: Methods to reliably structure data when the source format or load 
  point is expected to vary over time, or when inputs lack structure completely and are 
  not immediately compatible with typical data manipulation packages (ex. OCR output, 
  user-edited Excel sheets). Streamlines a few string methods to make field verification 
  with pattern recognition easier.
