## Overview
Methods to reliably structure data when the source format or load point is expected to vary over time; or when inputs lack structure completely and are not immediately compatible with typical data manipulation packages. For situations where connection points are pdfs or user-edited Excel sheets, and table dimensions and naming conventions need to be dynamically set using pattern recognition. 

## Motivation
To enhance code readability and increase the resilience of data pipelines between uncommon sources and standardized reports. In keeping with the report oriented end result, a few methods included in this package are aimed at preparing data for export.
